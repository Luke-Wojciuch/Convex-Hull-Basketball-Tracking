# üèÄ Convex-Hull-Basketball-Tracking

**A real-time computer vision system that analyzes geometric formations in basketball by tracking players, referees, and the ball using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack.** The system maps player positions onto a radar-style minimap, highlighting spatial arrangements, defensive structures, and offensive sets as they evolve during live gameplay.

## üìå Project Description

### What It Does  
This system processes basketball game footage in real time to track players, referees, and the ball. It then maps this data onto a radar-style minimap, providing a geometric analysis of team formations. The radar can be displayed in the corner of the screen or expanded to full view, offering coaches, analysts, or fans a dynamic understanding of team structure and spacing.

### Why These Technologies  
- **YOLOv8** for real-time, high-accuracy object detection.  
- **ByteTrack** for robust and stable multi-object tracking.  
- **OpenCV** for efficient frame processing and visual rendering.  

### Challenges Faced  
- Ensuring **accurate tracking** in high-speed or congested gameplay environments.  
- Implementing a reliable **homography transformation** to project positions from video footage to a bird's-eye radar view, adaptable across camera angles.

## üõ† Useability

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basketball-vision-tracker.git
cd basketball-vision-tracker

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Running the System

Once everything is set up, you can run the system on a video using:
### Input Guidelines

- The input video should show **one half court clearly visible**. This is essential for the homography transformation to accurately map player positions onto the radar view.
- Use wide-angle footage to ensure that most or all players and referees remain in view.
- Recommended video resolution is **720p or higher** to ensure optimal detection and tracking performance.
- Supported video formats include `.mp4`, `.avi`, and others supported by OpenCV.

### Output

- The system will display a real-time visualization with bounding boxes around players, referees, and the ball, along with a radar-style minimap.
- After processing, the output video with overlays and radar will be saved in the `output/` directory as `processed_video.mp4`.

### Hardware Requirements

- **Recommended**: A machine with an NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX 3060 or better), CUDA installed, and at least **8GB of VRAM** for real-time performance.
- **Minimum**: A CPU-only setup will work, but the system may run significantly slower and may not achieve real-time processing.

### Data Disclaimer

- Due to file size constraints, **not all data used during development and testing is included in the repository**.
- This includes large training datasets, full game footage, and model checkpoints beyond the default YOLOv8 weights.
- If you wish to replicate or extend the project, you may need to collect your own basketball footage and annotated datasets, or contact the author for potential access to additional data resources.
