# üèÄ Convex-Hull-Basketball-Tracking

**A real-time computer vision system that analyzes geometric formations in basketball by tracking players, referees, and the ball using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack.** The system maps player positions onto a radar-style minimap, highlighting spatial arrangements, defensive structures, and offensive sets as they evolve during live gameplay.

## üìå Project Description

### What It Does  
This system processes basketball game footage in real time to track players, referees, and the ball. It then maps this data onto a radar-style minimap, providing a geometric analysis of team formations. The radar can be displayed in the corner of the screen or expanded to full view, offering coaches, analysts, or fans a dynamic understanding of team structure and spacing.

### Why These Technologies  
- **YOLOv8** for real-time, high-accuracy object detection.  
- **ByteTrack** for robust and stable multi-object tracking.  
- **OpenCV** for efficient frame processing and visual rendering.  

### Challenges Faced  
- Ensuring **accurate tracking** in high-speed or congested gameplay environments.  
- Implementing a reliable **homography transformation** to project positions from video footage to a bird's-eye radar view, adaptable across camera angles.
